ASP.NET MVC
1. ASP.NET MVC Framework
Q: What are the main components of the ASP.NET MVC framework and how do they interact?
A: The main components are Model, View, and Controller. 
The Model represents the data and business logic, the View displays the data, and the Controller handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly1.

2. ASP.NET vs. ASP.NET MVC
Q: How does ASP.NET MVC differ from traditional ASP.NET Web Forms?
A: ASP.NET MVC uses the Model-View-Controller pattern, which provides better separation of concerns, testability, and control over HTML.
 Web Forms use a more event-driven approach with less control over HTML and more reliance on server controls1.

3. Working with Controllers
Q: What is the role of a Controller in ASP.NET MVC?
A: A Controller handles user input, interacts with the Model, and selects a View to render the output1.

4. Routing
Q: What is routing in ASP.NET MVC?
A: Routing is the process of mapping URLs to Controller actions. It allows for clean, SEO-friendly URLs1.

5. Action Filters
Q: What are Action Filters in ASP.NET MVC?
A: Action Filters are attributes that can be applied to controllers or actions to perform logic before or after an action method executes. Examples include Authorize, HandleError, and OutputCache1.

6. Passing Data from Controller to View
Q: How can you pass data from a Controller to a View in ASP.NET MVC?
A: Data can be passed using ViewBag, ViewData, or strongly-typed models1.

Working with Views
1. Razor View Engine
Q: What is the Razor View Engine?
A: Razor is a markup syntax that allows you to embed server-based code into web pages using C# or VB.NET. It is designed for creating dynamic web pages with a clean and concise syntax1.

2. HTML Helpers
Q: What are HTML Helpers in ASP.NET MVC?
A: HTML Helpers are methods that generate HTML markup. Examples include Html.TextBoxFor, Html.DropDownListFor, and Html.ActionLink1.

Exploring Models & Working with Data
1. Model Binding
Q: What is Model Binding in ASP.NET MVC?
A: Model Binding is the process of creating .NET objects using the data sent by the browser in an HTTP request1.

2. Data Annotation
Q: What are Data Annotations in ASP.NET MVC?
A: Data Annotations are attributes that provide metadata for model properties, such as validation rules and display formats1.

Entity Framework 6 Features with ASP.NET Scaffolding
1. Code First Model
Q: What is Code First in Entity Framework?
A: Code First allows you to define your model using C# or VB.NET classes. The database schema is then created based on these classes1.

2. Multiple Migrations
Q: How do you handle multiple migrations in Entity Framework?
A: Migrations allow you to incrementally update your database schema to keep it in sync with your model. You can add, update, or remove migrations as your model changes1.

Web Optimization with ASP.NET MVC
1. Bundling & Minification
Q: What is bundling and minification in ASP.NET MVC?
A: Bundling combines multiple files into a single file to reduce the number of HTTP requests. Minification removes unnecessary characters from code to reduce file size1.

Using ASP.NET Identity in ASP.NET MVC
1. ASP.NET Identity
Q: What is ASP.NET Identity?
A: ASP.NET Identity is a membership system that adds login functionality to your application. It supports features like two-factor authentication, account lockout, and external logins1.

ASP.NET Web API
1. Web API Features
Q: What are the key features of ASP.NET Web API?
A: ASP.NET Web API is a framework for building HTTP services that can be consumed by a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. It supports RESTful services and can return data in JSON or XML format2.

2. Web API Routing
Q: How does routing work in ASP.NET Web API?
A: Web API uses attribute routing to define routes directly on controller actions. This allows for more control over the URIs and the parameters2.

3. Content Negotiation
Q: What is content negotiation in Web API?
A: Content negotiation is the process of selecting the best representation for a given response when there are multiple representations available. It is based on the client’s request headers2.
